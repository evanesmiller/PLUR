Write a plain-text safety briefing (no markdown, no bold, no headers with #). Use these sections separated by blank lines:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Two sentences on overall risk level.

RISK ASSESSMENT
Which stages and time windows are most dangerous and why. Be specific with stage names and times.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Practical actions the ops team should consider — where to focus staff, where crowd flow needs attention, timing concerns. Keep it actionable.

AMENITY PLACEMENT
Based on hotspot locations and crowd flow, suggest whether any restrooms, water stations, or bars should be repositioned to better distribute crowds and reduce congestion and wait times at those locations. Be specific about which facility and where to move it.
